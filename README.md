# Dominoes
Dominoes is a two player game.

## Description
1. a domino is a playing piece that is characterized by the two numbers written on it. 
   The numbers are integers and can range from 0 to 6.
2. A single domino piece has no orientation, so, a full domino set (that includes all 
   the possible pairs of numbers) will have 28 unique dominoes.

## Rules of game
1. At the beginning of the game, each player is handed 7 random domino pieces. 
   The rest are used as stock (the extra pieces).
2. The player with the highest domino or the highest double ([6,6] or [5,5] for example)
   will donate that domino as a starting piece for the game.
3. After doing so, their opponent will start the game by going first. If no one has a double domino, 
   the pieces are reshuffled and redistributed.
